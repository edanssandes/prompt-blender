# PromptBlender

## Overview

PromptBlender is an innovative tool designed to automate the generation, execution, and analysis of prompts for use with various language learning models (LLMs), including but not limited to GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) models. It simplifies the task of creating multiple prompts by automatically filling parameters within a template, generating a Cartesian product of prompts, and analyzing the results returned by the model's API.

## Features

- **Template-based Prompt Generation**: Easily create prompt templates and let PromptBlender fill in the parameters for you.
- **Automatic Parameter Combination**: Generates a Cartesian product of given parameters to explore a wide range of prompt possibilities.
- **API Integration**: Seamlessly sends generated prompts to LLM APIs for execution (currently only ChatGPT).
- **Results Analysis and Consolidation**: Analyzes the responses from the LLMs, providing insights and consolidating the data for easy review.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later.
